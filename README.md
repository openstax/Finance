Trouble-Free Tracking Time for Product Teams
Britt Weinstein
July 22, 2020
Problem Identified: 
Using TrackingTime is very labor intensive for individuals. Work often requires a great deal of task switching, and this must be replicated within TrackingTime. Additionally, many managers are not getting value out of the granularity that TrackingTime offers. 
However, some product teams find time based data useful in the following ways:
quantify time spent on tasks or developing features
track budgets and provide insight into the cost of activities
data is needed for funding and audit requirements for some projects
Solution: 
Utilizing a tool that already exists in OpenStax workflows, Github, active issue age can be tracked to identify the time spent on particular tasks. Once a release tag has been applied to an issue in Github, there is no further work required of individuals to track work. Project Managers (PMs) will track the age of each issue on the backend, in Domo. Data will be used in combination with the product personnel report that is maintained by the PMs to generate reports for Product Managers (PDMs) & finance.
Goals:
Eliminate the need for members of product teams to log time, saving time and money.
Cancel the TrackingTime subscription and save the money spent on licensing.
Provide data to PDMs about the time and cost of developing product and/or features.
Deliver data that finance needs for funding/audit requirements.
The number of hours dedicated to a funded project during a specified time period
The number of employees on the project during a specified time period
The amount of money spent on the project during a specified time period.
Utilizing the release functionality in Github will allow us to see how many hours were spent and how many team members worked on an issue. Mapping the collected hours information to employee pay information will allow us to have information on project cost.
Implementation: 
PMs will create a new release in the Finance Github repository through requests from Finance or PDMs. 
Releases will be  human-readable and mapped to funding sources on the backend by PMs and finance.
Utilizing Github releases is the best solution because an issue can contain multiple releases. So, multiple forms of information can be tracked (IE: the release for tracking issue age and the release for a certain product feature).
Every issue that is in a stage beyond the backlog must have a release applied. 
On the backend, PMs can track issue age for issues that have the release applied. 
Improvements that OpenStax Will See: 
This will save OpenStax about $15,000 per year by canceling the TrackingTime subscription. 
There will be very few releases to choose from, eliminating the confusion between categories. 
The only work that individuals need to do is apply the release to the card in Github. Once this is done, the issue tracks itself and there is no further action required. This is a huge relief of responsibility on all individuals.
